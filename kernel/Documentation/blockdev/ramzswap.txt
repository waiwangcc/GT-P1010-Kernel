ramzswap: Compressed RAM swap device
------------------------------------

Project home: http://compcache.googlecode.com

This module creates RAM based block device (named ramzswap0) which acts
as swap disk. Pages swapped to this disk are compressed and stored in
memory itself.

It uses these components:
 - xvMalloc: memory allocator (xvmalloc.ko)
 - LZO1X: de/compressor: (lzo_compress.ko, lzo_decompress.ko)

Usage:
 - modprobe ramzswap [memlimit_kb=<val>|disksize_kb=<val>] [backing_swap=<dev>]

   memlimit_kb: This param is applicable only when backing_swap is given.
	It is limit on amount compressed data stored in memory. Any
	additional data is forwarded to backing_swap. It cannot be greater
	than backing device size. If missing or 0, default value is used:
	15% of RAM or backing device size, whichever is smaller.

   disksize_kb: This param is applicable only when backing_swap is not given.
	It is limit on amount of *uncompressed* worth of data stored in
	memory. For e.g. disksize_kb=1024 means it can hold 1024kb worth of
	uncompressed data even if this data compresses to just, say, 100kb.
	If missing or 0, default value is used: 25% of RAM.

   backing_swap: This is block device to be used as backing store for ramzswap.
	It must be a valid swap partition. We move data to this device when we
	encounter incompressible page or memlimit is reached. TODO: we may also
	move some pages from ramzswap to this device in case system is really
	low on memory.
	This device is not directly visible to kernel as a swap device
	(/proc/swaps will only show /dev/ramzswap0 and not this device).
	Managing this backing device is the job of ramzswap module.

Examples:
	1) modprobe ramzswap memlimit_kb=10240 backing_swap=/dev/sda2
	sets ramzswap limit as 10MB and /dev/sda2 as backing swap device.
	NOTE: here /dev/sda2 is a valid swap partition.

	2) modprobe ramzswap backing_swap=/dev/sda2
	same as (1) but memlimit is set to default: 15% of RAM or size of
	backing swap device, whichever is smaller.

	3) modprobe ramzswap disksize_kb=10240
	sets ramzswap disk size as 10MB.

	4) modprobe ramzswap.ko
	same as (3) but ramzswap disk size will be set to default:
	25% of RAM size.

	Once module is loaded, activate this swap with highest priority:
	swapon /dev/ramzswap0 -p 100
	(-p param set swap priority)

Notes:
 - ramzswap stats are exported via /proc/ramzswap
 - If you give non-swap partition as backing_swap, nothing bad will happen -
   swapon will simply fail to recognize /dev/ramzswap0 as swap partition.
   So, in this case, unload the module and reload with correct backing_swap.
